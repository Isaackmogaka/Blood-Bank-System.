        <h4>Blood Collection</h4>
        <img  class = "serviceimg" src="/Images/ayub5.png" alt="">
        <p> 
    Blood donation services employ trained phlebotomists who <br>
      collect blood from donors. The most common method is venipuncture, <br>
     where a needle is inserted into a vein, usually in the arm, <br>
    to draw a specified volume of blood. <br>
      The process is generally safe and causes minimal discomfort.

        <img  class = "serviceimg" src="/Images/ayub2.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>
     Blood donation services have specific criteria to determine donor  eligibility. <br>
      Factors such as age, overall health, weight, and medical history are taken into consideration. <br>
      Donors may need to undergo a screening process, which includes a questionnaire and a brief <br> medical examination, 
      to ensure the safety of both the donor and the recipient.

     until they are needed. Blood donation services maintain inventory levels based on demand <br>
      and regularly supply blood products to hospitals, clinics, <br>
      and other medical facilities where transfusions are performed. <br>

      encourage individuals to donate blood regularly. They often organize <br>
      blood drives in collaboration with community organizations, schools,<br>
       and workplaces. Additionally, these services provide educational materials <br>
        and resources to raise awareness about the importance of blood donation <br>
        and address common misconceptions.
